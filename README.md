I developed this project as part of the Udacity Code Reviewer course.

This is an inventory app that implementes a Realm database. It allows you to create item records, view them in a list, and modify their quantities on a detail layout. On the detail screen, you can sell the item by clicking on the Fab button, modify the quantities, or send an email to the vendor for reorder.
